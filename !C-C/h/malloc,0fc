## malloc.h - Goes with RunAsb.o

## #define NULL (void*) 0

extern void* malloc ( int );
extern void* realloc( void * , int );
extern void  free   ( void * );

##  malloc() realloc() and calloc() all return null if the allocation failed.
##   An error should only occur if the heap has been corrupted.
##   'No room' should return NULL.
##
## malloc(0) returns size of largest block, realloc(0,0) free space in heap
##
##  Suggested route is this: Call OS_Heap as required. If an error occurs, call
##   OS_Heap 1. If no error is returned, the heap has integrity and return of 0
##   is fine. Otherwise the heap is corrupt and an error should be raised.
##
##  Also wrong is reading the size of a block directly. Use OS_Heap 6.
