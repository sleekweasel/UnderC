OverC was my third year project at Warwick University, to run on my A3000.

This is two projects: !OverC, which is a bootstrapping C compiler written in
BBC BASIC, and !C-C which is my half-written C translation of OverC.

OverC seems to run on RISC OS 3.71 (particularly rpcemu), but not on the
Raspberry Pi for some reason - it gets an illegal something or other.

This repository is in the form of an rpcemu 'hostfs', so filetypes are stored
as ,xxx at the ends of files. If you want to run it on a real machine, you'll
need to run something - like the provided ./retype as an OBEY file.
