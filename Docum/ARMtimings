ARM Timings
--- -------

Sequential cycles used to access memory in sequential order, eg a series
 of group one instructions with no branching interruptions or Ldr/Ldm.

Non-sequential cycles: non-sequenial memory accessed. Eg first intruction
 after a branch will use an n cycle

Internal cycles. No memory access. internal op only.

typical ARM - clock is 8MHz.

        S cycles - 125ns RAM, 250ns ROM
        N cycles - 250ns RAM/ROM
        I cycles - 125ns RAM/ROM

Skipped conditional instructions always execute in 1 s-cycle.

Group 1. Mov, Add etc - 1 s-cycle
                                  + 1s if rhs has a shift count from a reg
                                               (ie not from a constant)
                                  + 1s+1n if dest is R15

Group 1a. Mul, Mla - 1s+16i is worst case
                     1s     is mult by 0 or 1


Group 2. Ldr 1s+1n+1i             + 1s+1n if dest is R15
         Str 2n

Group 3. Ldm (regs-1)s+1n+1i      + 1s+1n if R15 is loaded
         Stm 2n+(regs-1)s

Group 4. B,BL 2s+1n

Group 5. SWI 2s+1n                + the routine's time of course.
