Suggest:

* Stick more rigidly to the literal grammar of ANSI C, and only do the checking
	in the bits which build internal structures.

* Manage building internal structures so that a call to the tokeniser could
	easily free everything. This means that nexttoken(), backtoken() and
	freetoken() should no longer be used, in favour of seetoken() and
	poptoken(), which allow the tokeniser to keep hold of all tokens in use.
	steptoken() should pop the current token and return the following one.

	Also means that internal structures should have 0 in all invalid pointers
	over calls to tokens.
